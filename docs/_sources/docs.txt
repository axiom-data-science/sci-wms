==========
Background
==========

* No tools for comparing multiple unstructured models out of the box
* WMS technologies don't support unstructured meshes in a format the preserves topology
* Consensus building around a UGRID-CF proposal conventions
* Vast amount of large collections of met-ocean data available over OpenDAP

========
Features
========

* Syles that preserve unstructured mesh topology
* Sophisticated layer specification and style syntax
* Closely linked to matplotlib the predominant Python library for scientific plotting
* Support for groups of datasets
* Topologically correct GetFeatureInfo querying on unstructured meshes and regular grids

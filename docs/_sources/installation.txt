Installation
============

===================
System Requirements
===================

* >= 4GB RAM But it depends directly on the size and extents of the datasets you will be visualizing.
* > 2 CPU (> 4 CPU Better) 
* Python 2.7.x with sqlite
* LibGeos (http://download.osgeo.org/geos/)
* LibSpatialIndex (http://libspatialindex.github.com)
* netCDF4 C library (with opendap enabled, if opendap/remote functionality is desired)
* libhdf5 C library (dependency of netCDF4)
* libcurl (required for opendap)

Your system may have already installed the following dependencies, but 
they are required by some of the module dependencies installed in the next section.

* libpng
* libfreetype
* libjpeg
* libevent

Download
========

`Download the compressed project and unpack anywhere. <https://github.com/asascience-open/sci-wms>`_ This is where the installation will live.

Install the following Python dependencies using ``pip``, ``easy_install``, or equivalent. 

If you are using `virtualenv <http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/>`_, just make 
sure you have the environment activated before you try to install the packages or point to the environment with pip on the install command::

    $pip install numpy
    $pip install django>=1.4
    $pip install gunicorn
    $pip install gevent
    $pip install matplotlib>=1.2.0
    $pip install netCDF4
    $pip install shapely
    $pip install rtree

You also need to ensure that you have basemap matplotlib toolkit installed, 
which isn't available from pypi::

    $wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/matplotlib/files/matplotlib-toolkits/basemap-1.0.6.tar.gz
    $pip install basemap-1.0.6.tar.gz


If your version of the HDF5 C libraries is >=1.8.10, you may have to install 
the netCDF4 Python module from the source repository in order for it to work properly. 
This requires an SVN client to be installed on your system. (Please let us know if 
you have problems importing netCDF4 in Python after running this command)::

    $pip install -e svn+http://netcdf4-python.googlecode.com/svn/trunk#egg=netCDF4


If your NetCDF4 and HDF5 libraries are in non-typical locations, you will need to pass the locations to the `pip` command::

    $NETCDF4_DIR=path HDF5_DIR=path pip install netCDF4


If there is problem with gevent or greenlet, or if you would like gunicorn 
to use an alternative worker, you can install the `eventlet` worker. With some configuration 
of the sci-wms gunicorn configuration files,  you can also use `tornado` workers::

    $pip install eventlet
    $pip install tornado

=============
Run the Tests
=============

To make sure that dependencies have been installed correctly, and that sci-wms is fully functional. 
Run the following command to run the tests from the command line::

    cd sci-wms/src/pywms && python manage.py test
